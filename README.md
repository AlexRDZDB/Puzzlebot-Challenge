# Manchester Robotics - Puzzlebot Navigator Project
This repository contains ROS2 packages for controlling and simulating a Puzzlebot Robot provided by Manchester Robotics

## Project Objectives

## Packages

### Controllers
The `controllers` package contains nodes that control the robot's state and pose

#### Nodes
1. **`position_controller`**: Implements a PID Controller for managing the robotâ€™s position.
2. **`speed_controller`**: Applies modifiers to the signals generated via the position_controller node to adjust robot speed according to detected traffic signals
3. **`odometry_node`**: Computes the robot's odometry based on wheel velocity and encoder readings.

### Image Processing
The `image_processing` package contains node that uses the Puzzlebot's camera to obtain information about the environment

#### Nodes
1. **`camera_sim`**: Uses the computer's laptop to simulate the camera stream from the robot. Used for development purposes
2. **`image_processor`**: Obtains the camera image and distributes processed versions of the image to nodes that require it
3. **`traffic_signal`**: Detects whether it sees a red, yellow, or green light to tell the robot the maximum speed at which it should move
4. **`line_detector`**: Detects the line that the robot needs to follow *Missing Implementation*

 ### Simulations
 The `simulations` package contains nodes and launch files to run the robot simulations

 #### Nodes
1. **`rviz_visualizer`**: Simulates the robot in a format compatible with RViz
